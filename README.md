This is my first game written in JS using phaser.io. It is just for learning purposes. Feel free to clone or fork it to make things better or different. If you do so, let me know :)

## Prerequisites
You need at least these packages installed globally:
- ```sudo npm install gulp -g```
- ```sudo npm install bower -g```

## Installation
- ```npm install```
- ```bower install```
- ```gulp```

The executable game is now located in public/. Just link your web server to it, or start index.html directly in your browser.
